--BAD TIME--
MUSIC MADE BY NICE DICE - SMG CITY

[Chorus: blxty]
My head don't feel right
I see you cry
I don't really blame you 'cause we're both having a bad time
They say they don't change
Promise I'm not like the last guy
Blacked out last night, woke up with a black eye
My head don't feel right
I see you cry
I don't really blame you 'cause we're both having a bad time
They say they don't change
Promise I'm not like the last guy
Blacked out last night, woke up with a black eye

[Verse: mental]
I don't wanna talk but they driving me insane
Next time we drift apart, ima stay away
I don't wanna deal, I can't deal with all this pain
Fall apart еvery time you say my name
Hopе I mean a lot to you
'cause you mean a lot to me
And it seems we're falling through
But I'll never let you be
Said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
I don't wanna feel
Put a pill in my drink
I just want love
I'll do anything
Do what you want
You pushed me to the brink

[Bridge: mental]
Feel your aura
Girl I like it way too much
You make it colder
Hope you're just another crush

[Chorus: blxty]
My head don't feel right
I see you cry
I don't really blame you 'cause we're both having a bad time
They say they don't change
Promise I'm not like the last guy
Blacked out last night, woke up with a black eye
My head don't feel right
I see you cry
I don't really blame you 'cause we're both having a bad time
They say they don't change
Promise I'm not like the last guy
Blacked out last night, woke up with a black eye
